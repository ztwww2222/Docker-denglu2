        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Pangu creation myth is a Chinese legend that tells the story of how the universe was formed. According to this ancient tale, before the existence of the world, there was only chaos and darkness.</p>

        <h2>The Birth of Pangu</h2>
        <p>In the beginning, a cosmic egg called the "Taiji" contained everything. Inside this egg, the opposing forces of Yin and Yang were in balance. After countless eons, the egg cracked open, and from it emerged Pangu, a giant with incredible strength.</p>

        <h2>Pangu's Great Work</h2>
        <p>As Pangu grew, he realized that the Yin and Yang energies needed to be separated to bring order to the universe. With a giant axe, he split the cosmic egg into two halves, creating the earth and the sky. Pangu stood in the middle, holding them apart to prevent them from rejoining.</p>

        <h2>The World's Formation</h2>
        <p>For thousands of years, Pangu continued to grow taller, and the earth and sky continued to separate. His breath became the wind, his voice became thunder, and his hair turned into forests and fields. When he finally passed away, his body transformed into the various elements of nature, shaping the world as we know it.</p>

        <h2>Legacy of Pangu</h2>
        <p>The legend of Pangu is a fundamental story in Chinese mythology and has inspired countless generations. It symbolizes the creation of the world and the balance of cosmic forces. Even today, Pangu's legacy continues to influence Chinese culture and philosophy.</p>
